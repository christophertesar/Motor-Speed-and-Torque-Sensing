# Motor-Speed-and-Torque-Sensing
This is a project I made with my group members at British Columbia Institute of Technology. Our project was to measure the speed and torque of a DC motor coupled to a sycnronous 
generator. The torque was measured by increasing the power load on the generator, increasing the generated torque from the prime mover (the DC motor). We were able to do this
by programming a TI MSP 432 microcontroller connected to a load cell and amplifier. We also used a 16x2 LCD display to show the results.
